For this assignment you will use the results from the previous assignment. You should create a new git project which does the following:

1. Ingest the results from the previous assignment from you and all of your group members. You should be able to print out a single file that has rolled all of these results together into a single combined format. (This might involve writing a unique script for each member's contribution. This is practice for standardizing data which might come in many different formats from different sources.)

2. A second script which reads the output from step 1 and sorts all of the company's purposes by sentiment. (Choose whichever method for sentiment you would like.) Report the top 10 and bottom 10 results. (Hint: learning about lambda functions might be useful here.)

3. Report anything you notice about the data as you are working with it. I'm not looking for anything in particular here, this is simply to encourage you to engage in some tangential learning while working with this data.
